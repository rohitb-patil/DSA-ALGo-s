1: BUBBLE SORT - Bubble Sort is a basic sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through a list, comparing and swapping adjacent elements until it's sorted.

2: MERGE SORT - Merge Sort is a divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm that recursively splits a list in half, sorts the halves, and then merges them back together.
